Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: Git creates a hidden folder where it stores all the metadata that needed for git to track changes in files. I need to do it to let git know that I want to start track changes of files in this directory.

A: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Q: Staging area kinda lies in between working directory and repository. Files that are to be committed are stored there. It gives flexibility and freedom to choose what to commit.
