Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When I'd like other people to be able to contribute to my project for instance or just to make my project 
publicly avalilable. Remote also can serve as a backup for my local files in case something happens with my computer
my files would be safe.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: I might not just be ready yet to see changes made by other contributors, I guess. It could lead to some inconvenieces...

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A: I would make a new branch when I need to divide my project into separate streamlines to be able to switch between them and merge them if needed. I would use clone if I had my remote repo on GitHub created, but I'd like to edit code on my local machine. To do that I'd have to clone that repo to my local machine. I would fork a repo which isn's mine if I wanted to add or change something in existing project. I need to fork it (and make my own copy of this repo) because I can't change anything in this repo since it isn't mine.
