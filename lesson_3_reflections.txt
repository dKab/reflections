Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: When I'd like other people to be able to contribute to my project for instance or just to make my project 
publicly avalilable. Remote also can serve as a backup for my local files in case something happens with my computer
my files would be safe.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: I might not just be ready yet to see changes made by other contributors, I guess. It could lead to some inconvenieces...
